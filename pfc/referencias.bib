  Abstract                 = {For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamiltonâ€“Jacobiâ€“Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses predictive state regulation of linear discrete-time systems subject to persistent bounded disturbances and to state and/or control constraints. It is well known that the joint presence of constraints and disturbances can drive a predictive controller to infeasibility and instability. Here it is shown how robustness against persistent bounded disturbances can be enforced by inserting in the predictive controller suitable constraint restrictions. The robust predictive controller obtained in this way guarantees, for all admissible disturbances, constraint fulfillment and asymptotic state regulation, i.e. convergence of the state to a minimal robust invariant set, provided that the initial state is feasible. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Current self-tuning algorithms lack robustness to prior choices of either dead-time or model order. A novel methodâ€”generalized predictive control or GPCâ€”is developed which is shown by simulation studies to be superior to accepted techniques such as generalized minimum-variance and pole-placement. This receding-horizon method depends on predicting the plant's output over several steps based on assumptions about future control actions. One assumptionâ€”that there is a â€œcontrol horizonâ€? beyond which all control increments become zeroâ€”is shown to be beneficial both in terms of robustness and for providing simplified calculations. Choosing particular values of the output and control horizons produces as subsets of the method various useful algorithms such as GMV, EPSAC, Peterka's predictive controller (1984, Automatica, 20, 39â€“50) and Ydstie's extended-horizon design (1984, IFAC 9th World Congress, Budapest, Hungary). Hence GPC can be used either to control a â€œsimpleâ€? plant (e.g. open-loop stable) with little prior knowledge or a more complex plant such as nonminimum-phase, open-loop unstable and having variable dead-time. In particular GPC seems to be unaffected (unlike pole-placement strategies) if the plant model is overparameterized. Furthermore, as offsets are eliminated by the consequence of assuming a CARIMA plant model, GPC is a contender for general self-tuning applications. This is verified by a comparative simulation study.},

Theorems show that the method stabilises general linear plants (e.g. unstable, nonminimum-phase, dead-time). Simulation studies demonstrate good behaviour with even nearly unobservable systems (where generalised predictive control is ineffective) and that control-costing is a particularly effective tuning parameter},

  Abstract                 = {The primary disadvantage of current design techniques for model predictive control (MPC) is their inability to deal explicitly with plant model uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new approach for robust MPC synthesis that allows explicit incorporation of the description of plant uncertainty in the problem formulation. The uncertainty is expressed in both the time and frequency domains. The goal is to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes a â€˜worst-caseâ€™ infinite horizon objective function, subject to constraints on the control input and plant output. Using standard techniques, the problem of minimizing an upper bound on the â€˜worst-caseâ€™ objective function, subject to input and output constraints, is reduced to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that the feasible receding horizon state-feedback control design robustly stabilizes the set of uncertain plants. Several extensions, such as application to systems with time delays, problems involving constant set-point tracking, trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, which follow naturally from our formulation, are discussed. The controller design is illustrated with two examples.},

The method is easy to understand/implement and has won popularity among many practicing engineers. Despite its success it does not have a general stability and robust stability theory. The paper proposes a new algorithm which deploys most of the ideas of GPC but yields control configurations with guaranteed stability and provides a systematic means of optimising robust stability margins. It achieves this through the use of a particular stabilising feedback controller which replaces the relevant transfer function operators by simple polynomial operators. This simplification also reduces the computational burden of a computer implementation of the method. The superiority of the results of the paper are illustrated by means of numerical examples.>},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method for enlarging the domain of attraction of nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). The usual way of guaranteeing stability of nonlinear MPC is to add a terminal constraint and a terminal cost to the optimization problem such that the terminal region is a positively invariant set for the system and the terminal cost is an associated Lyapunov function. The domain of attraction of the controller depends on the size of the terminal region and the control horizon. By increasing the control horizon, the domain of attraction is enlarged but at the expense of a greater computational burden, while increasing the terminal region produces an enlargement without an extra cost. In this paper, the MPC formulation with terminal cost and constraint is modified, replacing the terminal constraint by a contractive terminal constraint. This constraint is given by a sequence of sets computed off-line that is based on the positively invariant set. Each set of this sequence does not need to be an invariant set and can be computed by a procedure which provides an inner approximation to the one-step set. This property allows us to use one-step approximations with a trade off between accuracy and computational burden for the computation of the sequence. This strategy guarantees closed loop-stability ensuring the enlargement of the domain of attraction and the local optimality of the controller. Moreover, this idea can be directly translated to robust MPC.},

  Abstract                 = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

  Abstract                 = {An infinite horizon controller that allows incorporation of input
and state constraints in a receding horizon feedback strategy is
developed. For both stable and unstable linear plants, feasibility of
the contraints guarantees nominal closed-loop stability for all choices
of the tuning parameters in the control law. The constraints'
feasibility can be checked efficiently with a linear program. It is
always possible to remove state constraints in the early portion of the
infinite horizon to make them feasible. The controller's implementation
requires only the solution of finite-dimensional quadratic
programs},

  Abstract                 = {A new method of digital process control is described. It relies on three principles: 1.(a) The multivariable plant is represented by its impulse responses which will be used on line by the control computer for long range prediction;2.(b) The behavior of the closed-loop system is prescribed by means of reference trajectories initiated on the actual outputs;3.(c) The control variables are computed in a heuristic way with the same procedure used in identification, which appears as a dual of the control under this formulation. This method has been continuously and successfully applied to a dozen large scale industrial processes for more than a year's time. Its effectiveness is due to the ease of its implementation (e.g. constraints on the control variables) and to its amazing robustness as concerns structural perturbations. The economics of this control scheme is eloquent and figures can be put forward to demonstrate its efficiency. Optimality does not come from extraneous criteria on the control actions but from minimization of the error variance which permits computation of the set points of the dynamic control in a hierarchical way.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational simplicity is one of the most important aspects to take into account in robust model predictive control (MPC). In dead-time processes, it is common to use an augmented state-space representation in order to apply robust MPC strategies but, this procedure may affect computational aspects. In this paper, explicit dead-time compensation will be used to avoid augmented representation. This technique will be analyzed in terms of robust stability and constraint satisfaction for discrete-time linear systems. The results of this discussion will be applied to a robust tube-based MPC strategy which is able to guarantee robust stability and constraint satisfaction of a dead-time system by considering a prediction model without dead-time. Moreover, taking advantage of the proposed scheme, the robust MPC will be particularized for first-order plus dead-time models which simplifies significantly controller synthesis. The proposed dead-time compensation method will be applied to different robust MPC strategies in two case studies: (i) a simulated quadruple-tank system, and (ii) an experimental scaled laboratory heater process.},

state feedback MPC is globally asymptotically stabilizing if and only if
all the eigenvalues of the open loop system are in the closed unit disk.
With output feedback the eigenvalues must be strictly inside the unit
circle. The online optimization problem defining MPC can be posed as a
finite dimensional quadratic program even though the output constraints
are specified over an infinite horizon},
